# 42 Piscine Projects

Welcome to my 42 Piscine repository! 🏊‍♂️  
This repository contains all of my completed projects from the 42 School C programming bootcamp, up to module **C07**.

## 📚 About the 42 Piscine

The **42 Piscine** is an intense, month-long C programming bootcamp designed to test your logic, perseverance, and ability to learn independently. It is the main selection process to join the 42 School.

During the Piscine, participants go through a series of progressively challenging exercises and projects focused on core programming concepts, including:

- Memory management
- Pointers and arrays
- Functions
- Recursion
- String manipulation
- Basic data structures
- Algorithmic thinking

## 🗂️ Repository Structure

This repository includes the following directories:

- `Shell00` - Introduction to basic shell commands and file manipulation (ls, cd, cp, mv, rm, etc.)
- `Shell01` – Advanced shell scripting: loops, conditionals, text processing, and automation scripts to solve practical problems
- `C00` – Introduction to C, writing your first functions (e.g., `ft_putchar`, `ft_swap`, etc.)
- `C01` – Basic operations with strings and arrays
- `C02` – Memory and pointers
- `C03` – More advanced string handling
- `C04` – Function pointers and recursion basics
- `C05` – Iterative and recursive functions, mathematical operations
- `C06` – Working with `main`, strings, and standard I/O
- `C07` – Dynamic memory allocation and string operations

Each folder contains the exercises and source code I wrote during the Piscine.

## ⚙️ Technologies

- Language: **C**
- IDE: Any terminal text editor (e.g., Vim, Emacs, VS Code)
- Compilation: `gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror`
